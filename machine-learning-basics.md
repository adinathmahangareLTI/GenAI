learning based on experiences

e.g. recognising cat among dogs

more data - more fine algorithm -  more accuracy

1. facial recogintion
2. text recognition
3. credit-card fraud detection
4. movie recommendation

combining statistics and computer science to build algorithms which can solve complex problems more efficiently
